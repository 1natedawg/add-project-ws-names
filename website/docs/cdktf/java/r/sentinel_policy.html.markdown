# tfe_sentinel_policy

Sentinel Policy as Code is an embedded policy as code framework integrated
with Terraform Enterprise.

Policies are configured on a per-organization level and are organized and
grouped into policy sets, which define the workspaces on which policies are
enforced during runs.

~> **NOTE:** Managing policies and policy sets individually is [a deprecated feature in Terraform Cloud](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/policy-enforcement/manage-policy-sets), and we recommend always using versioned policy sets to manage policies.

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```java
import software.constructs.*;
import com.hashicorp.cdktf.*;
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import gen.providers.tfe.sentinelPolicy.*;
public class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
    public MyConvertedCode(Construct scope, String name) {
        super(scope, name);
        new SentinelPolicy(this, "test", new SentinelPolicyConfig()
                .description("This policy always passes")
                .enforceMode("hard-mandatory")
                .name("my-policy-name")
                .organization("my-org-name")
                .policy("main = rule { true }")
                );
    }
}
```
