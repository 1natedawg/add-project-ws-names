# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.tfe as tfe
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        tfe_project_test = tfe.project.Project(self, "test",
            name="myproject",
            organization="my-org-name"
        )
        tfe_team_admin = tfe.team.Team(self, "admin",
            name="my-admin-team",
            organization="my-org-name"
        )
        tfe_team_project_access_admin =
        tfe.team_project_access.TeamProjectAccess(self, "admin_2",
            access="admin",
            project_id=cdktf.Token.as_string(tfe_project_test.id),
            team_id=cdktf.Token.as_string(tfe_team_admin.id)
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
