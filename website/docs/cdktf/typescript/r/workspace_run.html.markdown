# tfe_workspace_run

Provides a resource to manage the _initial_ and/or _final_ Terraform run in a given workspace. These initial and final runs often have a special relationship to other things that depend on the workspace's existence, so it can be useful to manage the completion of these runs in the same Terraform configuration that manages the workspace.

There are a few main use cases this resource was designed for:

- **Workspaces that depend on other workspaces.** If a workspace will create infrastructure that other workspaces rely on (for example, a Kubernetes cluster to deploy resources into), those downstream workspaces can depend on an initial `apply` with `wait_for_run = true`, so they aren't created before their infrastructure dependencies.
- **A more reliable `queue_all_runs = true`.** The `queueAllRuns` argument on `tfeWorkspace` requests an initial run, which can complete asynchronously outside of the Terraform run that creates the workspace. Unfortunately, it can't be used with workspaces that require variables to be set, because the `tfeVariable` resources themselves depend on the `tfeWorkspace`. By managing an initial `apply` with `wait_for_run = false` that depends on your `tfeVariables`, you can accomplish the same goal without a circular dependency.
- **Safe workspace destruction.** To ensure a workspace's managed resources are destroyed before deleting it, manage a `destroy` with `wait_for_run = true`. When you destroy the whole configuration, Terraform will wait for the destroy run to complete before deleting the workspace. This pattern is compatible with the `tfeWorkspace` resource's default safe deletion behavior.

The `tfeWorkspaceRun` expects to own exactly one apply during a creation and/or one destroy during a destruction. This implies that even if previous successful applies exist in the workspace, a `tfeWorkspaceRun` resource that includes an `apply` block will queue a new apply when added to a config.

## Example Usage

Basic usage with multiple workspaces:

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as tfe from "./.gen/providers/tfe";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const tfeOrganizationTestOrganization = new tfe.organization.Organization(
      this,
      "test-organization",
      {
        email: "admin@company.com",
        name: "my-org-name",
      }
    );
    const tfeOauthClientTest = new tfe.oauthClient.OauthClient(this, "test", {
      apiUrl: "https://api.github.com",
      httpUrl: "https://github.com",
      oauthToken: "oauth_token_id",
      organization: tfeOrganizationTestOrganization,
      serviceProvider: "github",
    });
    const tfeWorkspaceChild = new tfe.workspace.Workspace(this, "child", {
      name: "child-ws",
      organization: tfeOrganizationTestOrganization,
      queueAllRuns: false,
      vcsRepo: {
        branch: "main",
        identifier: "my-org-name/vcs-repository",
        oauthTokenId: cdktf.Token.asString(tfeOauthClientTest.oauthTokenId),
      },
    });
    const tfeWorkspaceParent = new tfe.workspace.Workspace(this, "parent", {
      name: "parent-ws",
      organization: tfeOrganizationTestOrganization,
      queueAllRuns: false,
      vcsRepo: {
        branch: "main",
        identifier: "my-org-name/vcs-repository",
        oauthTokenId: cdktf.Token.asString(tfeOauthClientTest.oauthTokenId),
      },
    });
    const tfeWorkspaceRunWsRunParent = new tfe.workspaceRun.WorkspaceRun(
      this,
      "ws_run_parent",
      {
        apply: {
          manualConfirm: false,
          retryAttempts: 5,
          retryBackoffMin: 5,
          waitForRun: true,
        },
        destroy: {
          manualConfirm: false,
          retryAttempts: 3,
          retryBackoffMin: 10,
          waitForRun: true,
        },
        workspaceId: cdktf.Token.asString(tfeWorkspaceParent.id),
      }
    );
    new tfe.workspaceRun.WorkspaceRun(this, "ws_run_child", {
      apply: {
        manualConfirm: false,
        retryAttempts: 5,
        retryBackoffMin: 5,
      },
      dependsOn: [tfeWorkspaceRunWsRunParent],
      destroy: {
        manualConfirm: false,
        retryAttempts: 3,
        retryBackoffMin: 10,
        waitForRun: true,
      },
      workspaceId: cdktf.Token.asString(tfeWorkspaceChild.id),
    });
  }
}

```

With manual confirmation:

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as tfe from "./.gen/providers/tfe";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const tfeOrganizationTestOrganization = new tfe.organization.Organization(
      this,
      "test-organization",
      {
        email: "admin@company.com",
        name: "my-org-name",
      }
    );
    const tfeOauthClientTest = new tfe.oauthClient.OauthClient(this, "test", {
      apiUrl: "https://api.github.com",
      httpUrl: "https://github.com",
      oauthToken: "oauth_token_id",
      organization: tfeOrganizationTestOrganization,
      serviceProvider: "github",
    });
    const tfeWorkspaceParent = new tfe.workspace.Workspace(this, "parent", {
      name: "parent-ws",
      organization: tfeOrganizationTestOrganization,
      queueAllRuns: false,
      vcsRepo: {
        branch: "main",
        identifier: "my-org-name/vcs-repository",
        oauthTokenId: cdktf.Token.asString(tfeOauthClientTest.oauthTokenId),
      },
    });
    new tfe.workspaceRun.WorkspaceRun(this, "ws_run_parent", {
      apply: {
        manualConfirm: true,
      },
      destroy: {
        manualConfirm: true,
        waitForRun: true,
      },
      workspaceId: cdktf.Token.asString(tfeWorkspaceParent.id),
    });
  }
}

```

With no retries:

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as tfe from "./.gen/providers/tfe";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const tfeOrganizationTestOrganization = new tfe.organization.Organization(
      this,
      "test-organization",
      {
        email: "admin@company.com",
        name: "my-org-name",
      }
    );
    const tfeOauthClientTest = new tfe.oauthClient.OauthClient(this, "test", {
      apiUrl: "https://api.github.com",
      httpUrl: "https://github.com",
      oauthToken: "oauth_token_id",
      organization: tfeOrganizationTestOrganization,
      serviceProvider: "github",
    });
    const tfeWorkspaceParent = new tfe.workspace.Workspace(this, "parent", {
      name: "parent-ws",
      organization: tfeOrganizationTestOrganization,
      queueAllRuns: false,
      vcsRepo: {
        branch: "main",
        identifier: "my-org-name/vcs-repository",
        oauthTokenId: cdktf.Token.asString(tfeOauthClientTest.oauthTokenId),
      },
    });
    new tfe.workspaceRun.WorkspaceRun(this, "ws_run_parent", {
      apply: {
        manualConfirm: false,
        retry: false,
      },
      destroy: {
        manualConfirm: false,
        retry: false,
        waitForRun: true,
      },
      workspaceId: cdktf.Token.asString(tfeWorkspaceParent.id),
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `workspaceId` - (Required) ID of the workspace to execute the run.
* `apply` - (Optional) Settings for the workspace's apply run during creation.
* `destroy` - (Optional) Settings for the workspace's destroy run during destruction.

Both `apply` and `destroy` block supports:

* `manualConfirm` - (Required) If set to true a human will have to manually confirm a plan in Terraform Cloud's UI to start an apply. If set to false, this resource will auto confirm the plan. The exception is the case of policy check soft-failed where a human has to perform an override by manually confirming the plan even though `manualConfirm` is set to false. Defaults to `false`.
* `retry` - (Optional) Whether or not to retry on plan or apply errors. When set to true, `retryAttempts` must also be greater than zero inorder for retries to happen. Defaults to `true`.
* `retryAttempts` - (Optional) The number to retry attempts made after an initial error. Defaults to `3`.
* `retryBackoffMin` - (Optional) The minimum time in seconds to backoff before attempting a retry. Defaults to `1`.
* `retryBackoffMax` - (Optional) The maximum time in seconds to backoff before attempting a retry. Defaults to `30`.
* `waitForRun` - (Optional) Whether or not to wait for a run to reach completion before firing the next run. When set to false, `manualConfirm` will not be considered as run will be started with auto apply set to true . Defaults to `true`.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the run created by this resource.
