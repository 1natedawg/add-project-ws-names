/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.

import * as tfe from "./.gen/providers/tfe";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const tfeProjectTest = new tfe.project.Project(this, "test", {
      name: "myproject",
      organization: "my-org-name",
    });
    const tfeTeamAdmin = new tfe.team.Team(this, "admin", {
      name: "my-admin-team",
      organization: "my-org-name",
    });
    const tfeTeamProjectAccessAdmin =
      new tfe.teamProjectAccess.TeamProjectAccess(this, "admin_2", {
        access: "admin",
        projectId: cdktf.Token.asString(tfeProjectTest.id),
        teamId: cdktf.Token.asString(tfeTeamAdmin.id),
      });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    tfeTeamProjectAccessAdmin.overrideLogicalId("admin");
  }
}
